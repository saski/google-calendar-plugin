# FIC Plans Storage

## Storage Location

All intermediate plans generated with FIC (Frequent Intentional Compaction) commands MUST be stored in:

**`thoughts/plans/`**

## File Naming Convention

Plans should follow this naming pattern:

```
thoughts/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md
```

Examples:
- `thoughts/plans/2026-01-08-google-calendar-plugin-fix-icon-loading.md`
- `thoughts/plans/2026-01-07-google-calendar-full-year-view.md`
- `thoughts/plans/2026-01-02-oauth-implementation-plan.md`

## When to Use This Location

- Plans generated from FIC_COMMAND.md or FIC_PROMPT.md
- Implementation plans created during development
- Task breakdowns and step-by-step guides
- Any intermediate planning documents

## What NOT to Store Here

- Final documentation (use root-level README.md or docs/)
- Research documents (use `thoughts/research/` if needed)
- Project status (PROJECT_STATUS.md can stay here or move to root)
- User-facing guides (can stay here or move to docs/)

## Integration with FIC Workflow

This location aligns with the FIC workflow's Plan Phase:
- Plans are created during the Plan Phase
- Stored in `thoughts/plans/` for persistence
- Referenced during Implementation Phase
- Updated as needed during Validation Phase
